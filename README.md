Jae's record of self-teaching reinforcement learning (RL), as it's used in psychological research. Also a record of self-teaching Python(!), so lacks any sort of the elegance of well-written Python.

Inspirations (from existing tutorials) cited in the introductory sections of the Jupyter notebooks where they're referenced.
